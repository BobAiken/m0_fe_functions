# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?
    I think my time management is pretty solid. Before I start the day I make a note of the priority of tasks, then go down the list as the day goes on.
- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?
    The recipe example in the lesson was good. I would tell the 5 year old that creating a function is like writing a recipe, you give a list of instructions, and calling the function would be like following the recipe.
- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.
    Parameters are the variables that the function needs to function. Arguments are the values you want the parameters to be for that function call.
- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group?
    I have no questions/topics I want to ask to my small group.
